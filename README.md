# Snake 3D

Welcome to the world of Snake 3D, where you take on the role of a serpent, a creature of myth and legend, as it navigates a perilous and ever-changing environment. The game is under development, with the initial stages already complete, and promises to deliver a unique and captivating experience to players.

## Inspiration

Snake 3D draws inspiration from several sources, including Daniel Shiffman's book, "The Nature of Code," which explores how natural systems can be modeled using computation. It also takes inspiration from the game Rain World, which features a procedurally generated world and complex creature interactions. In Snake 3D, the world is alive and full of danger, with creatures evolving and adapting to the player's actions, making each playthrough an unpredictable and exciting journey.

## Gameplay

The world of Snake 3D is vast and unpredictable, with each playthrough creating a unique and challenging environment for the serpent to navigate. As the serpent moves through the environment, it must interact with other creatures to evolve and adapt, unlocking new abilities and becoming more powerful. However, some creatures are dangerous and will attack the serpent on sight, so it must be cautious and choose its interactions wisely.

The creatures in the game have procedural animations and derive their functionality from the principles of complexity science, evolution, and emergence. They are trained neural networks that can evolve over time to adapt to the player's strategies. Some will evolve to kill the serpent, while others will evolve to survive it, creating a dynamic and ever-changing ecosystem for the player to explore.

Snake 3D also features multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other in a complex and challenging environment. With the help of compute shaders, the game features complex calculations and simulations performed in real-time, creating a world that is alive and constantly evolving.

## Mechanics

- Procedurally generated world: The world of Snake 3D is procedurally generated, ensuring that each playthrough is unique and challenging.

- Neural networks: The creatures in the game are trained neural networks that can evolve over time to adapt to the player's strategies.

- Evolution: The game draws heavily from the principles of evolution, with creatures evolving over time based on their interactions with the environment.

- Emergence: The game features emergent behavior, with creatures interacting with each other in complex and unpredictable ways.

- Multiplayer: The game features multiplayer functionality, allowing players to compete against each other in a dynamic and challenging environment.

- Compute shaders: The game features compute shaders, which allow for complex calculations and simulations to be performed in real-time.

## Work in Progress

Snake 3D is still under development, and there are several features planned for the future, including:

- Additional creature types and animations.

- Improved AI and neural networks.

- More complex and challenging environments.

As the serpent navigates the world of Snake 3D, it will encounter danger, beauty, and wonder. It must adapt, evolve, and survive to become the ultimate predator in this ever-changing ecosystem. Will you rise to the challenge and become the serpent king?
